# CombatSimPython
This is a text based combat simulator
There are two players, which you can add your own name at the start.
There is a inventory for each player and there will get random items at the start.
Each player also gets a random Attack value and Defence value to give the game some variety.
When a pllayer gets done to 0 (Zero) health they lose
After each attack there is a function that checks the health of the player who was hit to see if it is > 0. if so game carries on.
There is so many ways this game can be improved and things added.
Eventually i will add graphics to the game and develop 2 AI agents to fight each other.
